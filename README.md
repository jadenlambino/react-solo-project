# At Large 
Live Link: https://at-large.herokuapp.com/

At large is a clone of the website Medium. I decided to put my own spin on Medium by basing it around a sort of true crime webstie where users can come read, and discover new cases and are also given the ability to write about their own opinions on the matter as well. I thought it would be a fun play on words of Medium because criminals are "at large" when they have not been caught and persecuted.

## Technology Used
* JavaScript
* React/Redux
* CSS
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku

## Future Plans
Overall I would like to do a mayor restyle of the website, and make it so that it is less clunky than it is in its current state. I would also love to be able to impliment more functionality to the website itself such as likes and follows for users.

## Technical Implimentation 
The most challenging part for me was getting the thunk action and its returns to do the correct thing within the app. Its not perfect but I have a much better understanding of react and redux as a whole so I think that this was a very good learning experience.
